# This code is written by Mark - using all the tools of his time.
# Things Mark would have done next:

# - Pick a number between 0 and 90
# - Pick a random number between 0 and 90
# - Then temperature setting.

# - Then check for responses between 0 and 9. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3899545/

# - Random number 900 runs, and different temperatures "can we trust this hyperparameter" and "can we trust when we ask for randomness".
# - What if we prompt differently?
# - Compare to a human research and human irrationality.
# - Compare to Benfords law and other research:
# - Now visualize nicely with a heatmap for each experiment.
# - Then potentially try for different models (gpt, llama, etc.)
